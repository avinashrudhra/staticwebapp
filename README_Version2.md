# Sample CSS + HTML Website

This is a minimal, responsive website built with plain HTML and CSS (no build tools required).

Files:
- `index.html` — the page
- `css/styles.css` — stylesheet

How to preview:
1. Clone or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `file:///`).

Notes:
- Images in the demo are loaded from Unsplash (external).
- The contact form is for demo purposes only (no backend).
- You can customize colors in `css/styles.css` using the CSS variables at the top.

Enjoy!
